# _Spark Spotify Data_

#### By _**Jarret Jeter**_

#### _Here I use the Spark technology to do some data cleaning on a csv file of Spotify artist data_

## Technologies Used

* _Python_
* _Spark_

## Description

_This is pretty excessive to use Spark for, but it's just a small practice example on my local computer_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Make sure you have a text editor such as Visual Studio Code installed._
* _Have a running version of Python3.7_
* _Clone this repository (https://github.com/jarretjeter/Spark-Spotify-Data.git) onto your local computer from github_
* _In your terminal create a virtual environment ('python3.7 -m venv venv'), activate it ('source venv/bin/activate') and then install the requirements ('pip install -r requirements.txt')_
* _In the root project directory, create a folder named "data", go to the directory in your terminal and then run the command 'gsutil -m cp gs://data.datastack.academy/spotify/spotify_artists.csv ./data' to retrieve the csv data_
* _Once you have the data downloaded, add a name (such as "row") to the csv header index column to avoid errors_
* _With that all done you can run the notebook cells in the 'main.ipynb' file to see some simple examples of Spark_

## Known Bugs

* _No known bugs at this time_
